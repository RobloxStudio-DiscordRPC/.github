# Welcome

This organization represents a project that shows Discord rich presence for Roblox Studio.

Rich presence is a discord feature that shows what you're currently doing in your profile card, which appears when you click someone's name or profile picture on Discord, for example:

![profile card](/profile/assets/profile_card.png)

![scripting](/profile/assets/rpc_script.png)

![building](/profile/assets/rpc_building.png)

![gui](/profile/assets/rpc_gui.png)

# Installation

You need to install an application and a Roblox Studio plugin for the service to work.

1. Download, extract and run the [rich presence client](https://github.com/RobloxStudio-DiscordRPC/RPC-Client/releases)
2. Download the [roblox studio plugin](https://github.com/RobloxStudio-DiscordRPC/Plugin/releases) and copy it to `%localappdata%\Roblox\Plugins\`
3. Make sure you have Discord and Roblox Studio running. Roblox Studio doesn't need to be in a place
4. Run the rich presence client
5. Hopefully that's it!
